    "1. Limited Contextual Understanding: i.e. two topics - polar bears and climate change - it will struggle to find relevant chunks that talk about both topics.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Inconsistent quality and relevant of chunks retrieved\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Poor integration of retrieval and generation:\n",
    "* Retriever and generator are usually operating in silos and independent\n",
    "* Generative Model doesn't fully leverage the retrieved information\n",
    "* For example, ignore some of the retrieved context information sometimes!\n",

    "* Not adapting well with user needs without intervention\n",
